### Summary

This release introduces a new management plane for Mizar, designed and
developed from the ground up. The design relies on extensibility
features in Kubernetes including Custom Resource Definitions and
Operators. Mizar Management Plane has several objectives:

1. Replace Kubeproxy with the scaled endpoint
1. Improve Mizar usability and deployability
1. Improve Mizar control-plane and data-plane Interfacing and workflow
1. Facilitate end-to-end testing, validation, and performance
   benchmarks
1. Extensibility to support other data-plane technologies, including ebpf, OVS, and host-networking.

integrations.
