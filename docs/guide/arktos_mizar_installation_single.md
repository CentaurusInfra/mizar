# Arktos and Mizar Single Node Installation Guide

## Introduction

This document is intended for new users to install Arktos platform with Mizar as the underlying network technology. 

For more details on Arktos installation, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/centaurus-cloud/arktos/blob/master/docs/setup-guide/arktos-enforces-network-feature.md)

## Installation Steps
1. Prepare lab machine, the prefered OS is **Ubuntu 18.04**. If you are using AWS, the recommanded instance size is ```t2.2xlarge``` and the storage size is ```128GB``` or more 

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/centaurus-cloud/mizar.git
cd mizar
chmod 755 setup-machine-arktos.sh
./setup-machine-arktos.sh
```
The lab machine will be rebooted once above script is completed, you will be automatically logged out of the lab machine. 

2. Log onto your lab machine, then run ```bootstrap.sh``` script from the mizar project folder to bootstrap your lab machine. 

3. Once bootstrap is completed, you can then compile mizar: 

```bash
cd ~/mizar
sudo su
make
make proto
```

4. Build arktos-network-controller (as it is not part of arktos-up.sh yet)
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/go/src/k8s.io/arktos
make all WHAT=cmd/arktos-network-controller
sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```
Also, please ensure the hostname and its ip address in /etc/hosts. For instance, if the hostname is ip-172-31-41-177, ip address is 172.31.41.177:
```text
127.0.0.1 localhost
172.31.41.177 ip-172-31-41-177
```

5. Before installing Mizar, you will need first start up Arktos server: 

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/go/src/k8s.io/arktos
./hack/arktos-up.sh
```

Then wait till you see: 

```
To start using your cluster, you can open up another terminal/tab and run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/var/run/kubernetes/admin.kubeconfig
Or
  export KUBECONFIG=/var/run/kubernetes/adminN(N=0,1,...).kubeconfig

  cluster/kubectl.sh

Alternatively, you can write to the default kubeconfig:

  export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=local

  cluster/kubectl.sh config set-cluster local --server=https://ip-172-31-16-157:6443 --certificate-authority=/var/run/kubernetes/server-ca.crt
  cluster/kubectl.sh config set-credentials myself --client-key=/var/run/kubernetes/client-admin.key --client-certificate=/var/run/kubernetes/client-admin.crt
  cluster/kubectl.sh config set-context local --cluster=local --user=myself
  cluster/kubectl.sh config use-context local
  cluster/kubectl.sh
```

Once you see above text, your arktos server is now running. 
To verify, you can open a new terminal and run ```kubectl get nodes```, you should see a node running with the name starts with "ip" followed by the private ip address of your lab machine. 

You also want make sure the default kubernetes bridge network configuration file is deleted: 

```bash
sudo ls /etc/cni/net.d
(you should see two config files, one is mizar cni config and another one is bridge config)
sudo rm /etc/cni/net.d/bridge.conf
sudo ln -snf /var/mizar/etc/cni/10-mizarcni.conf /etc/cni/net.d/10-mizarcni.conf
```

To make sure containerd is running as expected, run: 

```bash
systemctl status containerd.service
```

to restart, run: 

```bash
systemctl restart containerd.service
```

6. Start Arktos network controller. From a new terminal window, run:

```bash
./_output/local/bin/linux/amd64/arktos-network-controller --kubeconfig=/var/run/kubernetes/admin.kubeconfig --kube-apiserver-ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```
where the ```kube-apiserver-ip``` is your lab machine's **private ip address**


7. Deploy Mizar. Open a new terminal window, and run: 
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/go/src/k8s.io/mizar
./deploy-mizar.sh
```

Please refer to [Running Mizar Management Plane](https://mizar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/getting_started/#running-mizar-management-plane) for how to inspect resources. 

## Test

To test your environment, you can first create an arktos network object ```my-net-mizar-1```. Then create a pod in ```my-net-mizar-1```:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/go/src/k8s.io/mizar

kubectl create -f mizar/obj/tests/test_arktos_net.yaml

kubectl create -f mizar/obj/tests/test_pod_arktos_vpc1.yaml

```
